Architecture
============

Definition
----------

My understanding of the termin "software architecture" is based on two definitions:

1. "That which is fundamental to understanding a system in its environment" (ISO/IEC/IEEE 42010)
2. "Things that people perceive as hard to change" (Fowler, M. (2003). "Design - Who needs an architect?")
 
According to these definitions, I want to document my system with the following aspects:

1. Tool Chain
2. Technology Stack
3. Important Design Decisions

As proposed by [Stefan ZÃ¶rner](http://www.dokchess.de/), for every issue I note
- the problem to be solved,
- possible solutions / options and
- the decision / solution with an explanation.


Tool Chain
-----------
- IDE
 - Problem: What IDE to use?
 - options: Eclipse (free, I use it at work and could get more familiar with it, great plugins BUT ALSO slow / unstable), IDEA (fast, very nice build-in features BUT ALSO costs money)
 - decision: **Eclipse**. To increase my productivity in the projects I get paid for, I have to get more familiar with the IDE used there.
- Source Control
 - Problem: What source control to use?
 - options: SVN (know it already BUT ALSO have to set up my own server), Git (can commit while being offline, great support including a repository through github BUT ALSO github costs money)
 - decision: **Git** with github because its only 7$ per month and I want to get more familiar with Git.
- Package dependency management tool 
 - TODO (decision for Degraph)

Technology Stack
----------------
- Persistence
 - Problem: How to persist user-specific data?
 - options: Oracle-SQL-database (already experience BUT ALSO expensive and heavy-weight), HSQLDB (free, light-weight BUT ALSO no experience), Java DB (free, light-weight, already integrated in JDK BUT ALSO a relational DBMS that makes ORM necessary in manual or automated form), object-oriented databases (no gap between the objects in RAM and the persisted objects BUT ALSO there seems to be no good and widly-known implementation)
 - decision: **ava DB**. I thought about using a NOSQL-DB but had no experience with that. Additionally, the gap between object oriented programming and realtional data storage can be bridget by ORMs or other techniques (see below).
- object-relational mapping
 - Problem: How to bridge the gap between object-oriented programming and relational persistence?
 - options: Hibernate (very good support, does 80% of the work with very less effort, have experience with it BUT ALSO the rest 20% of the work are quite cumbersome), TODO

Important Design Decisions
----------------
- Inter component communication in user interface code
 - Problem: Given that functionality is divided into smaller fragments that only have limited tasks and responsabilities, how should these modules communicate to each other? An example is one component that represents a dialog and another component that represents a table on another dialog. If data is inserted into the first component, how does it get to the table in the other component?
 - Options: Observer-Pattern (components can be registered in components and get notified if a change occurs) (widely known, have experience with it), eventbus (all components post events to a bus on via which all components are connectedand can be notified of change) (sounds easy enough to implement it BUT ALSO no expertise with it)
 - decision: **Inter component communication via Observer Pattern** because the UI components already form a tree. This tree structure can be used to bubble events up to the root and then communicate them down to every leave (W3C event model).
