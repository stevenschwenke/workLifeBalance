Architecture
============

Definition
----------

My understanding of the termin "software architecture" is based on two definitions:

1. "That which is fundamental to understanding a system in its environment" (ISO/IEC/IEEE 42010)
2. "Things that people perceive as hard to change" (Fowler, M. (2003). "Design - Who needs an architect?")
 
According to these definitions, I want to document my system with the following aspects:

1. Tool Chain
2. Technology Stack
3. Important Design Decisions

As proposed by [Stefan ZÃ¶rner](http://www.dokchess.de/) I also note for every problem
- the problem
- possible solutions and
- the decision / solution.
